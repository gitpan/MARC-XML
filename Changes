Revision history for Perl extension MARC-XML

0.93 Fri Feb 11 17:13:02 EST 2011
       - When slurping MARCXML records (e.g., via MARC::Batch), can
         now handle XML files that use a prefix
         to refer to the http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim namespace.
       - If trying to parse a MARCXML record that has omitted
         the <record> wrapper element, throw an exception
         with a more meaningful error message.
       - adjusted copyright statement further to meet Debian requirements
         (RT#48333)
       - set license in Makefile.PL
 
0.92 Thu Jul 30 22:37:07 EDT 2009
      - small documentation changes to close RT tickets #48334 and #48333
        filed by Jonathan from Debian world.
      - added license string to META.yml so that CPAN can pick it up

0.91 Tue Jul 28 2009
      - Nixing the stray space (always been there) in the schemaLocation
        attribute for single-record output
      - Properly apply the leader modification for USMARC to signal UTF-8
        encoding.
      - Escape '<', '>', and '&' used as indicator values and subfield labels 
        during XML output (Bill Erickson)
      - CPAN RT#34082: clarify names of header output switches

0.90 Fri Dec 14 2007
      - modifications to MARC::File::SAX to use LocalName rather than Name
        Name can contain a namespace prefix and cause parsing to fail
        Should be ok to rely on LocalName since the parser factory is
        requiring Namespace support?
      - MARC::File::SAX also can build up multiple records now, for use 
        in other SAX contexts like Net::OAI::Harvester. This required
        a few changes in MARC::File::XML as well.

0.88 Wed Nov 28 2007
      - String test for subfield code to avoid dropping $0 (Galen Charlton)

      - Fixed a typo in M::F::X that could be the origin of the test failure(miker)

0.85 Fri Feb 13 2007
      - fixed typo in handling of unimarc w/regard to marc8 (ppoulain)
