This directory contains a few sample scripts that use MARC::XML. 

- simple.pl : reads the t/marc.dat USMARC file and converts it 
  into an XML file called output.xml

- marc2xml.pl : is a script you can run from the command line to 
  convert USMARC records to XML. 

  usage: 
  marc2xml.pl inputfile outputfile

- xml2marc.pl : another script that you can run from the command
  line to convert a properly formatted XML document to USMARC.

  usage:
  xml2marc.pl inputfile outputfile

- pacific.pl converts not_quite_compliant MARC records from an old
  MS-DOS program into proper MARC and XML

- read_pfa.pl reads the output.xml file created by pacific.pl one record
  at a time and demonstrates remapping an entity into multiple characters.

  pacific0.dat is an example of the corrupt "before" data
